## About

This mod is mostly a collection of small tweaks I wanted to see in the game.

Some examples:
* Nations avoid spawning in some terrains (like desert), with some exceptions (like morocco).
* Palaces yield +2 food and 2 more production than they did before.
* Floating gardens are nerfed to +1 food per lake, as Aztecs are almost guaranteed to spawn next to lakes now.
* Fixed some typos.
